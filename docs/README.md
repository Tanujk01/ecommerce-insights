# E-commerce Sales & Customer Insights (SQL Project)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to extract actionable business insights
related to sales performance, customer behavior, order patterns, returns, and revenue concentration.

The analysis is entirely performed using **SQL (MySQL 8+)**, focusing on real-world
business questions that data analysts commonly solve.

##  Database Schema
The project uses the following core tables:
- customers (customer demographics & region)
- orders (order dates, return status)
- orderdetails (products & quantities per order)
- products (category & pricing)
- regions (geographical mapping)

---

##  Key Analysis Areas
The project answers questions such as:

### 1. Sales & Revenue Insights
- Total and monthly revenue trends
- Average order value (AOV)
- Revenue contribution by products and categories

### 2. Customer Behavior & Engagement

### 3. Returns & Refund Analysis
- Return rates by customer, product, and region
- Revenue loss due to returns
- Customers with frequent returns

### 4. Basket & Purchase Patterns
- Single-item vs multi-item orders

- Regional growth trends (MoM)
- Price sensitivity across regions

### 6. Sales Concentration & Efficiency
- Top 10% customers revenue dependency
- Order concentration (few large orders vs many small)
- Long-tail product contribution
