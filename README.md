## 🗂️ Database Schema
The project is built on a normalized relational schema consisting of:

- **customers** – customer details and regional mapping  
- **orders** – order dates and return status  
- **orderdetails** – product-level order quantities  
- **products** – product categories and pricing  
- **regions** – geographic segmentation  

This schema closely resembles real e-commerce production databases.
